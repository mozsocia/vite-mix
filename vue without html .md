### how to create a .vue file without template and target a html file where template will be

To create a Vue component that targets an external HTML template, you can use a render function approach instead of a template within the .vue file. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, create your Vue component file (e.g., `MyComponent.vue`) without a template section:

```javascript
<script>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  data() {
    return {
      // your data properties
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // your methods
  },
  mounted() {
    // component lifecycle hook
  }
}
</script>

<style>
/* your styles */
</style>
```

2. In your HTML file, define the template structure:

```html
<!-- index.html or any other HTML file -->
<div id="app">
  <div id="my-component-template">
    <!-- Your template content here -->
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

3. In your main JavaScript file (e.g., `main.js`), mount the Vue application and target the external template:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'

const app = createApp({
  components: {
    MyComponent
  },
  template: '#my-component-template'
})

app.mount('#app')
```

Alternative approach using render function:

If you need more control, you can use a render function in your component:

```javascript
<script>
import { h } from 'vue'

export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  render() {
    const template = document.getElementById('my-component-template')
    if (template) {
      return h('div', {
        innerHTML: template.innerHTML
      })
    }
    return h('div', 'Template not found')
  }
}
</script>
```

Important considerations:

1. Make sure the HTML file with the template is loaded before your Vue application initializes.

2. This approach might be less common and could have some limitations compared to using in-file templates.

3. You lose some Vue template compilation benefits when using external HTML.

4. Hot-reloading might not work as expected for the external template.

If you're using this approach, it's often for specific use cases such as:
- Integrating Vue into existing HTML-based projects
- Dynamic template loading
- Special build requirements

For most Vue applications, it's recommended to keep templates within .vue files for better tooling support and developer experience.


### what about this code ? is this correct ?

let productForm = new Vue({
  el: ".shopify-product-form",
  data() {
    return {

    }
  },
  methods: {

  }
});



This code uses the Vue 2 syntax and can work, but there are a few things to consider:

1. If you're using Vue 3, this syntax is outdated. For Vue 3, you would use:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const productForm = createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      // your data properties
    }
  },
  methods: {
    // your methods
  }
}).mount('.shopify-product-form')
```

2. If you are indeed using Vue 2, then your code is syntactically correct, but there are some considerations:

   - Make sure the element with class `shopify-product-form` exists in the DOM when this code runs
   - Be aware that using a class selector (`el: ".shopify-product-form"`) will only mount Vue to the first element it finds with that class

3. If you're integrating with Shopify, which this seems to be, make sure you're following Shopify's best practices for customizing the product form.

Here's a more complete example for Vue 2:

```javascript
let productForm = new Vue({
  el: ".shopify-product-form",
  data() {
    return {
      quantity: 1,
      selectedVariant: null,
      // other data properties
    }
  },
  methods: {
    updateQuantity(value) {
      this.quantity = value;
    },
    addToCart() {
      // handle add to cart functionality
    }
    // other methods
  },
  mounted() {
    // any initialization code
  }
});
```

If you're building a Shopify theme, you might also want to consider:

1. Whether you need to handle multiple product forms on the same page
2. How to handle dynamic updates to the form (like variant selections)
3. Integration with Shopify's Ajax API for cart functionality

If you provide more context about what you're trying to achieve, I can give more specific guidance.
